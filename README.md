# Exads
Exads technical test exercises


Technical details:
1) It was used PHP 8.0.3 for doing this technical test with Visual Studio Code as code edit.

2) Naming conventions have been respected, such as PSR1, PSR2, PSR4.

3) It has been interpreted that Exads wants to see how to establish a connection to the database without using an ORM, such as Eloquent. This ORM can be used without the need to use Laravel, however, due to the aforementioned interpretation, the connection has been established through Mysqli (it could also have been done with PDO).  A .sql file is included.

4) To comment code, @return, @author, and @param have been mainly used.  However, this does not imply that only those are always used. It depends on the needs of the project.
